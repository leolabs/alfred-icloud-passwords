# iCloud Passwords Workflow for Alfred

This workflow allows you to quickly find and copy iCloud passwords and OTPs to your clipboard.

It offers three keywords:

- `f <query>` – Open Preferences and search for the query
- `fp <query>` – Open Preferences, copy the first result's password, and quit
- `otp <query>` – Open Preferences, copy the first result's OTP, and quit

After a password or OTP has been copied, you'll get a notification about it.

The workflow makes use of AppleScript's accessibility controls, so you might have to give it 
permission to access them the first time you use it.
